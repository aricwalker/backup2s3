#                              application on your S3 account. When the limit is
#                              reached, the oldest backup will be deleted. 
#

#  -adapter section-

#
#                 S3cmdAdapter - Uses s3cmd 0.9.9.91 Python library found here: http://s3tools.org/s3cmd
#                                This adapter displays upload progress and also has 
#                                failsafes and throttling incase an upload fails.
#                                The failsafe will slow the upload speed and retry
